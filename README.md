### Official documentation website :white_check_mark: for deepNets package<br>
- Easy syntax and clear explanation :100: for each of the modules.
- The website is static since it's main purpose is for documentation. It's mostly built using HTML,CSS and some javascript.
- If you find any errors :eyes: or you need more explanation please raise a issue in this repo.
